Techdegree Project 4-Work Log w/ Database
_________________________________________

Introduction

This program was developed to implement skills that were learned for using databases in Python, using peewee, and unittesting. This program will allow a user to enter work logs into an SqliteDatabase and search them using various methods.


Installation

Once the techdegree_project_4 folder has been downloaded, the main program can be run in the terminal or console. The main program file is work_log.py. The program can be run from a virtual environment by entering 'pipenv run python work_log.py'. This will ensure that the program can be run regardless of the dependancies of the program.


Using the Program

The user can login using their own username. They then have the option to add a new entry, search existing entries, or quit the program. If the user would like to add a new entry they will supply a date, title, time spent, and optional notes for their log. The user is able to search existing logs by date, setting a date range, search by time, search term, username list, or search usernames. The user may delete or edit a log from the log view screen.
