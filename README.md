# Work Log w/ Database

This program was developed to implement skills that were learned for using the datetime module, SQLite database, and for utilizing REGEX. This program will allow a user to enter work logs into a SQLite database and search them using various methods.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github/ericsryan/techdegree_project_4.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd techdegree_project_4
```

3. Run the main program file `work_log.py` in the terminal or console:
```bash
python3 work_log.py
```

## Usage

The user has the option to add a new entry, search existing entries, or quit the program. If the user would like to add a new entry they will supply a date, title, time spent, and optional notes for their log. The user is able to search existing logs by date, setting a date range, search term, or REGEX pattern. The user may delete or edit a log from the log view screen.
